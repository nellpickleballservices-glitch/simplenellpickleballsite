## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-phase]: Supabase Auth over NextAuth — native RLS integration
- [Pre-phase]: `proxy.ts` (not `middleware.ts`) — Next.js 16 rename, verify before Phase 1
- [Pre-phase]: Content blocks in DB over external CMS — no third-party CMS dependency
- [Pre-phase]: Snapshot names in reservations — prevents identity mismatch on profile update
- [Phase 01-foundation]: test.skip() used in Playwright e2e stubs (test.todo() not available in Playwright v1.58)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: testIgnore: ['**/unit/**'] added to playwright.config.ts to prevent Vitest/Playwright Symbol conflict
- [Phase 01-foundation]: package.json initialized with type: module (ESM) for Next.js 15+ App Router compatibility

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Verify `btree_gist` extension is available on the Supabase project tier before Phase 3 commits to `tstzrange` exclusion constraint; fallback is unique constraint on `(court_id, session_start_time)` with fixed session lengths
- [Research]: Confirm current Stripe API version in Dashboard before Phase 2 (`2025-01-27.acacia` recommended but should be verified)
- [Research]: Check `@supabase/ssr` package changelog for any breaking changes after Aug 2025 before starting Phase 1
